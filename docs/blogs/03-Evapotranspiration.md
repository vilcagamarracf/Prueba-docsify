# Literature about Evapotranspiration

Information gathered from the [HydroLearn - Evapotranspiration](https://edx.hydrolearn.org/courses/course-v1:HumboldtState+ENGR440+2020_Fall/about) course, Humbold State University. This course is considered to be as an introductory hydrology course in graduate classes.

- Understand the role that evaporation plays in the hydrologic cycle.
- Learn the methods to estimate ET.
- Data from NOAA for Lake Michigan/Huron, eddy covariance datasets from the AmeriFlux as well as Landsat and Sentinel satellite datasets will be used to perform hydrologic investigations.
- Some programming activities will be done in Python and R environments. 

## Section 1 : Overview of Evapotranspiration (ET)

### To learn

- The role of ET within the hydrologic cycle at different temporal scales.
- Identify what type of PET estimation would be possible and select a metodology that would be most accurate given knowledge of data availability in a particularly location.
- Explain the difference between Potential an Actual ET.


### Background information

- Evaporation is a major flux over long-time scales (> monthly), but over the duration of a storm, ET is not a large flux.


### Actual and Potential AET

- Evaporation and Transpiration are complex processes that are controlled by both atmospheric conditions, as well as conditions in the terrestrial biosphere. 
- **Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)**: concept that allows us to estimate the atmospheric control over ET, and is defined as the amount of evaporation that would occur from an extensive open body of water under the existing atmospheric conditions. 
- **Reference-crop evapotranspiration (ETo)** which assumes an area planted with a specific reference crop without water limitations. This is what is calculated from the Penman-Montheith equation, which is the preferred method used to estimate ET, but it requires many input values that are not always known.
- **Actual ET (AET)** is the amount of water that actually evaporates and transpires from an area. This will usually be less than $PET$ or ETo, unless water is plentiful. Sometimes we can measure AET, but usually we estimate  AET from PET or ETo given knowledge of water availability and plant growth.  

> For fallow field that has not been irrigated or received rain for two weeks, which of the following would have the lowest value? \
PET, ETo or AET would be approximately equivalent.
